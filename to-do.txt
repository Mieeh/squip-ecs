- Grouping/tagging entities
[
Idea:
Say we have a ton objects called "bullets" and we want to modify all of them quickly/remove them all quickly
world.get_group("Bullets"); Would return a list of pointers to all entities "grouped/tagged" as "bullets"
]

- Ability to enable/disable enities 
[
This would mean they don't get updated when the world gets updated!
